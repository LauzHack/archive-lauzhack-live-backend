# LauzHack Live Backend

This is the backend repository for LauzHack's Live page. For the frontend, please check [lauzhack-live](https://github.com/LauzHack/lauzhack-live).

## Developing locally

At the time of development, the highest version that AWS Lambda supports is Python 3.6. Therefore, that must be installed. For installing multiple versions of Python in the same system, [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is recommended.
